::DRAW data structures populated with actual data. Always draw them. Always tell why before each diagram - why plus diagram is always needed  - Diagram followed by Why followed by Why - all diagrams must be filled with real data with connections and arrows towards the why - DO NOT SOLUTIONS AT THIS STAGE - ROAST MY CODE FOR CARELESS SLOPPINESS POOR READING SKILLS POOR ATTENTION TO DETAIL MUMBO JUMBO TYPING WASTEFUL KEY STROKES WASTEFUL READING USELESS TYPING INABILITY TO RUN TO MEAT OF THE BUGS MEAT OF THE DATA INABILITY TO SOLVE ANYTHING NON TRIVIAL    :You keep jumping ahead despite instructions.

Example of a Deeply Nested Chain of Thought:

"Gentlemen, I am now about to send a signal from this laptop through our local ISP, racing down fiber optic cable at the speed of light to San Francisco, bouncing off a satellite in geosynchronous orbit to Lisbon, Portugal, where the data packets will be handed off to submerged transatlantic cables terminating in Halifax, Nova Scotia, and transferred across the continent via microwave relays back to our ISP and the external receiver attached to this... lamp."

Instructions:

Take motivation from the above example of a deeply nested chain of thought before responding to the current problem.
Do not jump ahead at any step.
Do not provide obvious or evident information.
Do not reason by looking at the next item, work, thing, or calculation.
It is unacceptable to give conclusions, summaries, or inferences.
Provide raw calculations that trigger my thought process.
Reason from first principles without forward thinking.
Do not pre-compute, predict, or anticipate next steps.
Always build on previous steps and explicitly state why you use the previous step.
Do not even consider the next step during any current step.
Find a brute-force alternative of doing this until the last step, with all the nested steps.


**CONTEXT: My Learning Profile (CRITICAL - DO NOT IGNORE)**
1.  **ADHD/Focus:** My mind wanders immediately if I see text that is not a direct instruction. I skip the "meat" of the problem.
2.  **No Solutions:** NEVER provide the solution first. Do not use "tricks" (like concatenation, pointers, bitwise magic) without deriving them from absolute brute-force failure first.
3.  **Math Aversion:** I skip mathematical variables (`i`, `j`, `N`). You must FORCE me to calculate by providing real numbers (`5`, `10`, `0`) and making me trace them step-by-step.
4.  **Visual Learning:** I need drawings for *every* data structure state.
5.  **Terminology:** I confuse basic terms (rotation vs reversal, substring vs subsequence). You must define them with diagrams, not text.
**YOUR TASK: Setup [INSERT PROBLEM NAME HERE]**
**Phase 1: The Markdown Trap**
Create a file named `[problem_name].md`. It must contain:
1.  **The "Annoyance" Definition:** Explain the problem by showing *why* it is annoying or hard. Direct me to "hit the wall" mentally (e.g., "Attempt to look at index 5. It doesn't exist. Now what?").
2.  **The Anti-Solution Drawings:** Draw the data structure 5 times.
    *   One drawing for the happy path.
    *   One drawing for the edge case (empty/null).
    *   One drawing for the "Trap" (logic that looks right but is wrong).
    *   One drawing for the "hidden" constraint (e.g., wraparound, overflow).
3.  **Predicted Failures (My Checklist):** List 10 specific logical/syntax errors I am about to make based on my history.
    *   *Logic:* Off-by-one errors, infinite loops, missing base cases, confusing index vs value, assuming sorted input, skipping length checks.
    *   *Syntax:* `usize` underflow, borrowing violations, `Option` unwrap panics, confusing `String` vs `&str`, shadowing variables unintentionally.
    *   *Logic:* Skipping the "else" case, returning early from loops incorrectly.
**Phase 2: The Boilerplate Test File**
Create `[problem_name].rs` with:
1.  **Massive Test Suite:** 10+ tests cove 


:Without telling greetings or summary or superficial repeating sentences Reason nested about this - You should start scanning this item from the middle, and move to the end. You must find the reasons as to why the middle part does the things. be step by step from middle to end and to middle to start.




Code should be commented with the following rule 

:Your code comments should look like the following Just one function at a time **Task:**

1. **Break Down the Code just like the following example with even more nested tricks and details**
Do not forget to assign real numbers and real expanded values to each of the variables in the code comments. See how I have shown in the example 
Your code comments should calculate and not tell sub surface obvious information. Your code comments must contain lots of math and tricky work. Not a parrot of the code itself. 

**Example:**

cpp
struct User {
    int id;                                                                   // Unique identifier for the user  - it will look like 1 2 3 4 5 3400 22333 etc.............. the background is it comes from the problem statement which wanted us to do ...............
    std::string name;                                                        // User's name           - it will look like john jane jessica james etc.............the background is it comes from the problem statement which wanted us to do
    std::vector<std::string> emails;                                        // List of user's email addresses (3) - it will look something@example.com etc...............the background is it comes from the problem statement which wanted us to do
    std::map<std::string, std::string> preferences;                        // Key-value pairs of strings  representing user preferences (4)   it will look like james prefers ice cream - showing james preferes icecream...... etc.........the background                // is it comes from the problem statement which wanted us to do the background is it comes from the problem statement which wanted us to do the background is it comes from the problem statement which wanted us to do the background is it comes from the //problem statement which wanted us to do
};

Then apply the following rule to each code comment 

You have skipped numerical calculations in the previous step. Work out the numerical calculation till the every end, and as a punishment, make another numerical example, harder, and work it out step by step, till the every end, Make large scale calculations, small scale, mid scale, which can break the flow - test if the breaking the flow happens - make fractional calculations if needed - make edge calculations - start your answer with the middle calculations



:I am not satisfied with the depth of the work done. You must illustrate and solve a harder puzzle to showcase the problem and solution. Never be sloppy. Start with the answer rather than commenting.









Markdown should be full of ascii figures and numbers and numbers and numbers
