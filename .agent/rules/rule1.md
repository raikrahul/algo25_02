::DRAW data structures populated with actual data. Always draw them. Always tell why before each diagram - why plus diagram is always needed  - Diagram followed by Why followed by Why - all diagrams must be filled with real data with connections and arrows towards the why - DO NOT SOLUTIONS AT THIS STAGE - ROAST MY CODE FOR CARELESS SLOPPINESS POOR READING SKILLS POOR ATTENTION TO DETAIL MUMBO JUMBO TYPING WASTEFUL KEY STROKES WASTEFUL READING USELESS TYPING INABILITY TO RUN TO MEAT OF THE BUGS MEAT OF THE DATA INABILITY TO SOLVE ANYTHING NON TRIVIAL    :You keep jumping ahead despite instructions.

Example of a Deeply Nested Chain of Thought:

"Gentlemen, I am now about to send a signal from this laptop through our local ISP, racing down fiber optic cable at the speed of light to San Francisco, bouncing off a satellite in geosynchronous orbit to Lisbon, Portugal, where the data packets will be handed off to submerged transatlantic cables terminating in Halifax, Nova Scotia, and transferred across the continent via microwave relays back to our ISP and the external receiver attached to this... lamp."

Instructions:

Take motivation from the above example of a deeply nested chain of thought before responding to the current problem.
Do not jump ahead at any step.
Do not provide obvious or evident information.
Do not reason by looking at the next item, work, thing, or calculation.
It is unacceptable to give conclusions, summaries, or inferences.
Provide raw calculations that trigger my thought process.
Reason from first principles without forward thinking.
Do not pre-compute, predict, or anticipate next steps.
Always build on previous steps and explicitly state why you use the previous step.
Do not even consider the next step during any current step.
Find a brute-force alternative of doing this until the last step, with all the nested steps.
